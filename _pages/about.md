I originate from Santa Maria de Palautordera, a quaint town in Catalonia, where my love for outdoor pursuits like trail running, rock climbing, and hiking takes precedence. Alongside my passion for sports, I find joy in crafting tools, ranging from simple scripts to intricate models, aimed at aiding people. My diverse professional journey includes roles as a waiter, lighting engineer, and research assistant, coupled with active involvement in local cultural societies and university teaching.

I pursued my Telecommunication Engineering studies at the <a href='https://www.upc.edu/'>Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (UPC)</a>, specializing in signal processing and image processing. For my Bachelor's thesis at the <a href='https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html/'>University of Auckland (UoA)</a>, I delved into cardiac image analysis under the guidance of Alistair Young and Pau Medrano. Returning from New Zealand, my focus shifted to Advanced Telecommunication Technologies for my Master's studies at UPC, emphasizing advanced signal processing and data analysis. Once again, I ventured into cardiac image analysis for my Master's thesis, supervised by Xavier Giró and Kevin McGuinness. 

I obtained my PhD at <a href='https://dcu.ie/'>Dublin City University</a>, in the <a href='https://ml-labs.ie/'>ML-Labs Centre for Research Training in Machine Learning</a>, with a thesis titled “Generalizable Cardiac MRI Analysis with Deep Learning.” Under the supervision of Kevin McGuinness, Kathleen Curran, and Noel O’Connor, my research focused on advancing cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) analysis using deep learning techniques. This included generating synthetic CMR data for dataset balancing and developing predictive models, contributing to more robust and efficient cardiac MR analysis.

As part of my PhD studies at ML-Labs, I completed my internship at <a href='https://medisimaging.com/about/'>Medis Medical Imaging</a>, under the supervision of Pieter Kitslar and Hans Reiber.

I am currently a Researcher at the <a href='https://www.insight-centre.org/'>Insight Research Centre for Data Analytics</a> at the School of Medicine at <a href='https://www.ucd.ie/'>University College Dublin</a>. In the context of the <a href='https://smash-hcm.eu/'>SMASH-HCM</a> Project, I contribute in the Data management, biomarker discovery and data-based modelling. Additionally, I supervise Master's Students on their theses and contribute to a number of research proposals.
