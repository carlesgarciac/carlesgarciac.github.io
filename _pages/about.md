I was born in Santa Maria De Palautordera a small town between Barcelona and Girona, in Catalonia. While my passion is being outdoors doing sports such as trail running, rock climbing, or hiking; I enjoy designing tools that can help people, from the simplest script to a complex model. In the past, I have worked as waiter, lightning engineer and research assistance; while I was also involved in local cultural societies and in teaching at the university. Now I am focused in my research on cardiac MRI analysis while thrilled to what could go next.

At <a href='https://www.upc.edu/'>Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (UPC)</a>, I coursed my studies in Telecommunication Engineering, doing a major in signal processing and a minor in image processing. I did my Bachelor's thesis at <a href='https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html/'>University of Auckland (UoA)</a> in cardiac image analysis, under the supervision of Alistair Young and Pau Medrano. Upon my return from New Zealand, I started my Master studies in Advanced Telecommunication Technologies also at UPC, were I focused on advanced signal processing and data analysis. My Master's thesis also consisted in cardiac image analysis and this time it was supervised by Xavier Gir√≥ and Kevin McGuinness. 

I am currently at the fourth year of my Ph.D. and the title of my thesis is "Generalizable Cardiac MRI Analysis with Deep Learning", under the supervision of Kevin McGuinness, Kathleen Curran and Noel O'Connor. In my research, I have explored multiple arquitechtures, augmentation techniques and thecniques to extend available data with synthetic data. The main purpose of my research is to make cardiac MRI analysis tools reliave to all types of patient.

As part of my Ph.D. studies at ML-Labs, I completed my internship at <a href='https://medisimaging.com/about/'>Medis Medical Imaging</a>, under the supervision of Pieter Kitslar and Hans Reiber.
