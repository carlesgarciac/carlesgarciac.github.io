I was born in Santa Maria de Palautordera, a small town in Catalonia. While my passion is being outdoors doing sports such as trail running, rock climbing, or hiking, I enjoy designing tools that can help people, from the most straightforward script to a complex model. In the past, I have worked as a waiter, lighting engineer and research assistant; I was also involved in local cultural societies and teaching at the university. Now I am focused on my research on cardiac MRI analysis while thrilled about what could go next.

At <a href='https://www.upc.edu/'>Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (UPC)</a>, I coursed my studies in Telecommunication Engineering, doing a major in signal processing and a minor in image processing. I did my Bachelor's thesis at <a href='https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html/'>University of Auckland (UoA)</a> in cardiac image analysis under the supervision of Alistair Young and Pau Medrano. Upon my return from New Zealand, I started my Master's studies in Advanced Telecommunication Technologies, also at UPC, where I focused on advanced signal processing and data analysis. My Master's thesis also consisted of cardiac image analysis; this time, Xavier Gir√≥ and Kevin McGuinness supervised it.

I am currently in the fourth year of my PhD, and the title of my thesis is "Generalizable Cardiac MRI Analysis with Deep Learning", under the supervision of Kevin McGuinness, Kathleen Curran and Noel O'Connor. In my research, I have explored multiple architectures, augmentation techniques and techniques to extend available data with synthetic data. The primary purpose of my research is to make cardiac MRI analysis tools reliable for all types of patients.

As part of my PhD studies at ML-Labs, I completed my internship at <a href='https://medisimaging.com/about/'>Medis Medical Imaging</a>, under the supervision of Pieter Kitslar and Hans Reiber.
