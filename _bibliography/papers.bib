abstractNote={Methods that are resilient to artifacts in the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) while performing ventricle segmentation, are crucial for ensuring quality in structural and functional analysis of those tissues. While there has been significant efforts on improving the quality of the algorithms, few works have tackled the harm that the artifacts generate in the predictions. In this work, we study fine tuning of pretrained networks to improve the resilience of previous methods to these artifacts. In our proposed method, we adopted the extensive usage of data augmentations that mimic those artifacts. The results significantly improved the baseline segmentations (up to 0.06 Dice score, and 4 mm Hausdorff distance improvement).},

abstract="In this work, we approach the problem of cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image reconstruction from undersampled k-space. This is an inherently ill-posed problem leading to a variety of noise and aliasing artifacts if not appropriately addressed. We propose a two-step double-stream processing pipeline that first reconstructs a noisy sample from the undersampled k-space (frequency domain) using the inverse Fourier transform. Second, in the spatial domain we train a denoising GNA-UNET (enhanced by Group Normalization and Attention layers) on the noisy aliased and fully sampled image data using the Mean Square Error loss function. We achieve competitive results on the leaderboard and show that the algorithmic combination proposed is effective in high-quality MRI reconstruction from undersampled cardiac long-axis and short-axis complex k-space data.",

abstract="Possessing a balanced dataset to train the segmentation models used in clinical products is hugely important to enhance the performance in any given subset of patients. Due to demographics and uneven distribution of conditions of the subjects, this is not usually the case. In this work, we propose a novel method that synthetically balances a training dataset by applying deformations to an atlas. In particular, we focus on modelling two diseases that have distinct heart morphologies. Once the atlas is processed, we obtain different slice cuts from it and apply style transfer to make it appear as a real short-axis MRI scan. We then add those synthetic scans to our training set for the segmentation network. Our experiment compares the performance of the distinct trained models in a test set. Additionally, we also present the results on subsets of the test set representing the modelled pathologies. We found that using synthetic scans to balance the dataset resulted in up to a 0.05 increase in the DICE score. Our findings motivate further research on balancing cardiac MRI datasets by using atlas deformation.",
